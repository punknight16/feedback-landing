Hi all, I'm looking for a design partner for my next project. I am going to make a small app where people can fill out a questionnaire on their psychographics/demographics, read a landing page over the course of a few minutes while their actions are being tracked, and then write a quick summary of what was interesting and what was left to be desired about the landing page. For the beta, the payout will be a fake currency of around $.10 for the feedback giver, and the charge will be between $1 and $10 of fake currency to the client that wants feedback. I'll try to wrap up and launch on Product Hunt by September 1, but leave an option to continue to work until October 1. The product will likely make no money, but can be used as a portfolio project. If we decide to switch from fake currency to real currency, the money will be split 50/50 for as long as the partner is willing to work. If either of us decides to move on after launch, I'll make the project open source, and anyone will be free to fork and monetize the project as they wish. If anyone is interested in the project, and just wants updates feel free to dm me.
